In the construction of the abstract  game structure we overapproximate the belief-set of the agent at each step. Since we consider surveillance predicates that impose upper bounds on the size of the belief, such an abstraction  gives more power to the target (and, dually, less power to the agent).  This construction guarantees that the abstraction is \emph{sound}, meaning that an abstract strategy for the agent that achieves a surveillance objective corresponds to a winning strategy in the concrete game. This is stated in the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a surveillance game structure, $\part = \{Q_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be an abstraction partition, and $G_\abstr = \alpha_\part(G)$. For every surveillance objective $\varphi$, if there exists a wining strategy for the agent in the abstract belief-set game $(\alpha_\part(G),\varphi)$, then there exists a winning strategy for the agent in the concrete surveillance game $(G,\varphi)$.
\end{theorem}
{\it Proof.} Let $f_a$ be a winning strategy for the agent in $(\alpha_\part(G),\varphi)$, that is, for every strategy $f_t$ for the target in $\alpha_\part(G)$ it holds that $\outcome(\alpha_\part(G),f_a,f_t) \models \varphi$.

By the definition of the abstract game we have that for every prefix of a run $(\pi,B_t^{m+1}) = ((l_a^0,B_t^0)\ldots (l_a^m,B_t^m), B_t^{m+1})\in \states_\belief^+ \times \beliefs$ in $G_\belief$ we can fix some prefix of a run $\alpha(\pi,B_t^{m+1}) = ((l_a^0,A_t^0)\ldots (l_a^m,A_t^m), A_t^{m+1}) \in \states_\abstr^+ \times (\mathcal P(\part) \cup \range(\obs) \cup \{\{l_t^\init\}\})$ in $G_\abstr$ such that for every $i = 0,\ldots, m$ we have $B_t^i \subseteq  \gamma(A_t^i)$.

We define a strategy $f_{a,\belief} : \states_\belief^+ \times \beliefs \to \states_\belief$ for the agent in $G_\belief$ by setting for every $(\pi,B_t)\in \states_\belief^+ \times \beliefs$ $f_{a,\belief}(\pi,B_t) = (l_a,B_t)$, where $f_a(\alpha(\pi,B_t))=(l_a,A_t)$.

By the definition of $f_{a,\belief}$ we have that for every strategy $f_{t,\belief}$ for the target in $G_\belief$ we have that for  $(l_a^0,B_t^0)(l_a^1,B_t^1)\ldots =  \outcome(G_\belief,f_{a,\belief},f_{t,\belief})$ it holds that $B_t^i \subseteq \gamma(A_t^i)$ for all $i \geq 0$, where $(l_a^0,A_t^0)(l_a^1,A_t^1)\ldots =  \outcome(\alpha_\part(G),f_a,f_t)$ for some strategy $f_{t,\abstr}$ for the target in $G_\abstr$. Thus,
for every atomic surveillance predicate $p_k$ we have that if $A_t^i \models p_k$, then $B_t^i \models p_k$. The same holds for every atomic predicate $p$ and its negation, by the requirements on the abstraction partition. Thus, since $\outcome(\alpha_\part(G),f_a,f_t) \models \varphi$ we can conclude that $\outcome(G_\belief,f_{a,\belief},f_{t,\belief}) \models \varphi$.
