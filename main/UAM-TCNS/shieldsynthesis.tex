In this section we describe the shield synthesis procedure for each operating region. We first present the procedure informally.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each region $i$ we construct safety game $\mathcal{G}_i$ from the safety specification $\varphi_i$
    \item \todo{We model the shield synthesis as a GR(1) synthesis problem.}
    \item \todo{Only interfere minimally}
\end{itemize}
