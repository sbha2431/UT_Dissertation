\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_concl}
In this chapter, we presented a general approach to the synthesis of shields for multi-agent systems from temporal logic specifications. The key contribution is the study of quantitative objectives in the shield synthesis setting. The work is also the first to consider fairness requirements on the shields. We introduced the notion of interference cost, and discussed several costs and synthesis objectives that are of interest when considering multi-agent systems. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed approach on a range of quantitative interference requirements by synthesizing shields for a multi-UAV system.

A promising  avenue for future work is to investigate bounded synthesis~\cite{FinkbeinerS13} with quantitative objectives, in order to synthesize distributed shields, which will enhance the efficiency of shields for distributed systems.
