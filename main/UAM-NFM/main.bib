We aim to find the least-violating control strategy while considering different priorities of satisfying different parts of the mission. Formally, we consider the missions given in the form of linear temporal logic formulas, each of which is assigned a reward that is earned when the formula is satisfied. Leveraging ideas from the automata-based model checking, we propose an algorithm for finding an optimal control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards earned if this control strategy is applied. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an illustrative case study.},

In this paper, we focus on the case when the said task is not feasible without temporarily violating some of the rules. We propose an algorithm that {synthesizes} a motion which violates only lowest priority rules for the shortest amount of time. Although the proposed algorithm can be applied in a variety of control problems, throughout the paper, we motivate this problem with an autonomous car navigating in an urban environment while abiding by the rules of the road, such as "always stay in the right lane" and "do not enter the sidewalk." We evaluate the algorithm on a case study with several illustrative scenarios.},
