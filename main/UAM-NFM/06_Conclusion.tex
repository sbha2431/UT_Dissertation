\section{Conclusion} 
%We present a framework for a scalable and safe air traffic management system for UAM. 
The work in this paper is the first to consider a decentralized minimum violation planning approach for UAM traffic management. The method is generalizable and flexible, as it is agnostic to the design of the underlying vehicles being controlled, and it can handle any changes in the safety constraints and still provide guarantees. Empirical results show the practical viability of our approach and is able to handle large numbers of connected vertihubs and requests. For future work, we aim to incorporate online re-planning in order to react to incoming vehicle requests in real-time and still satisfy regulations as much as possible.
