% In this section, we present a method to synthesize candidate policies that are optimal for specific instantiations of the runtime information vector. In the next section, we show how we switch between the policies at runtime to obtain more optimal behaviour. 


% We follow the convention of \cite{hadaspaper,rudigerpaper}. \todo[inline]{elaborate from Kress-grazit robotics papers.}
