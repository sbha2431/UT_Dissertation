We aim to find the least-violating control strategy while considering different priorities of satisfying different parts of the mission. Formally, we consider the missions given in the form of linear temporal logic formulas, each of which is assigned a reward that is earned when the formula is satisfied. Leveraging ideas from the automata-based model checking, we propose an algorithm for finding an optimal control strategy that maximizes the sum of rewards earned if this control strategy is applied. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an illustrative case study.},

In this paper, we focus on the case when the said task is not feasible without temporarily violating some of the rules. We propose an algorithm that {synthesizes} a motion which violates only lowest priority rules for the shortest amount of time. Although the proposed algorithm can be applied in a variety of control problems, throughout the paper, we motivate this problem with an autonomous car navigating in an urban environment while abiding by the rules of the road, such as "always stay in the right lane" and "do not enter the sidewalk." We evaluate the algorithm on a case study with several illustrative scenarios.},

	abstract="Runtime enforcement is a powerful technique to ensure that a program will respect a given set of properties. We extend previous work on this topic in several directions. Firstly, we propose a generic notion of enforcement monitors based on a memory device and finite sets of control states and enforcement operations. Moreover, we specify their enforcement abilities w.r.t. the general Safety-Progress classification of properties. Furthermore, we propose a systematic technique to produce a monitor from the automaton recognizing a given safety, guarantee, obligation or response property. Finally, we show that this notion of enforcement monitors is more amenable to implementation and encompasses previous runtime enforcement mechanisms.",
